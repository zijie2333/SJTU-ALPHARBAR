# SJTU-AlpharBar
This project mainly aims to develop an intelligent cocktail mixer system-- **AlphaBar**, which is controlled by a smart phone on the front panel with a newly-designed AndroidApplication.

AlphaBar supports **three order modes**: 

- **Order by Menu**:

While  the cocktail is being made, the **light** and **music** provided attempt to create a supreme atmosphere for the drinker, together with **heart rate abnormity detection** offering a protection.

By entering **manager mode**, the system manager can look at cocktail making history and amount of rest materials, which may serve as information for further material purchase and cocktail recommendation. Besides, when the amount of a certain material is below a threshold, the system informs the manager to add that material.
